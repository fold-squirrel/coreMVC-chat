# coreMVC-chat
A simple chat app implemented in c# using the [asp.net core MVC](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview?view=aspnetcore-6.0) framework making use of __AJAX__  
This project was created as an assignment for my web development course

## note
- The js code is spaghetti and the UploadFile method in the ChatController might not work or might just throw an exception (I haven't tested it enough)
- Regardless if you have a similar assignment them what you can take from this project is how to make use of AJAX without needing jQuery, something that I think doesn't have enough beginner friendly documentation
- If you are going to work on this repo I suggest starting with the site.js file in wwwroot directory and break it down to multiple smaller files
